**Overview:**  

The Claims Billing System transforms healthcare claims processing by automating the generation and submission of EDI files. This automation turns tasks that would traditionally take hours into processes completed within seconds. It greatly enhances the efficiency of claims data interchange between payees or healthcare providers, such as Home Healthcare Agencies, other sectors (e.g. hospitals), and insurance companies (payors). The system ensures a seamless, secure, and swift billing cycle, revolutionizing interactions between providers and payers. 

The system generates the EDI 837 Professional file (837P) in compliance with the X12 Version 005010X222A1 standard. This ensures adherence to HIPAA requirements for healthcare transactions. The 837P format is designed for healthcare claim submissions. It promotes efficient data exchange between healthcare providers and insurance payors. By using this standard, the product I developed through this project upholds HIPAA's strict rules for patient data protection.

**Key Features:**

- **Automated EDI File Generation:** Streamlines the creation of 837P healthcare claims, significantly reducing manual effort and margin for error.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for ease of use, simplifying data input and management for seamless daily operations. (visit its repo for details)
- **Secure File Transmission:** Utilizes SFTP for the safe and compliant transfer of sensitive data (SFTP ). Is SFTP secure? depends on who you ask, right? But one thing is for sure. IBM is not too excited about it. Read: [link](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/AV17R94L)
- **Enhanced Efficiency:** By automating the submission of claims, the system vastly improves the billing process's speed and accuracy.

**Technologies Used:**

- **Frontend:** React, HTML5, CSS3 (repo link: [link](https://github.com/kenny-ahmedd/HealthClaimHub-EDI-837P-Interface))
- **Backend:** Java with Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA for robust, scalable server-side logic
- **Database:** MySQL for reliable data storage and retrieval
- **Security:** Integrated Spring Security and Firebase Authentication ensure secure access and data protection.
- **APIs:** RESTful design for flexible, efficient client-server communication
- **Tools:** Gradle for powerful build automation, IntelliJ IDEA for an optimized development environment

**Skills and Tools:**
*Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, RESTful APIs, MySQL, Firebase Authentication, SFTP, Gradle, IntelliJ IDEA, Version Control, CI/CD.*

The backend processes a series of requests from the Front-end through well-defined and secure API endpoints. Below is documentation detailing each endpoint for those looking to integrate this backend with their preferred Front-end or to enhance code readability.

## API Documentation
---
This is the API documentation for my Healthcare Claims Billing System. This guide provides detailed information on how to interact (or how the Front-End interacts) with the system's RESTful APIs to manage the generation and submission of healthcare claims efficiently.

#### Base URL

All URLs referenced in the documentation have the base path:

http://yourdomain.com/api


Replace `http://yourdomain.com` with the actual domain where the application is hosted. In the case of running it locally: `http://localhost:port/api`

#### Authentication

Most endpoints require authentication. Use the following header for requests:

Authorization: Bearer <Your_Firebase_Token>
